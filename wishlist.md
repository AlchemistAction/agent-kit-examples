## Ideas

1. Create an agent that monitors newly launched tokens, checks their market cap, and executes orders after a threshold is reached

2. Create an Agent that continuously evaluates lending rates across different protocols and then rebalances positions to capture the highest yields

3. Give an agent the ability to interact with DApps from the browser. [Example](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use)
